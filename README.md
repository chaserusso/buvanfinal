buvan final 
To run this program you must first download each file. Each file is a seperate class that works with the other so you must make a Java file in InteliJ naming it whatever you would like. After move each file into your new Java program under the src folder. When this is done the classes should implement each others methods. Node works with GFG, GFG and Node work with Main. To run the program simply press the run button in InteliJ, the values of the Nodes are preset but if you want to change them simply go to the main and edit where it says Inputs for the GFG graph and change the second value, which is the distance from each value of the edge for each Node. After that simply run the program and it should tell you the distance between edges using dijkstra's algorithm.
